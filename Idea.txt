Experiment with a ball bouncing in a box

MAJOR GOALS
1.  Make a 3D graph of how distance changes over time depending on the starting angle
2.  Make a 2D colored graph with x = time, y = starting angle, z = distance
3.  Try swapping axes in #2


Mini-milestones

1.  Setup environment with simple physics engine
2.  Render circle in middle of screen
3.	Render bounding container (box)
4.  Create launch function to simulate ball moving and bouncing off barrier
5.  Store position data with desired frequency
6.  Use simple chart / graph library
7.  Get initial graph of distance over time from one moving ball
8.  Run several simulations with angle increasing over time, and simulation time T
9.  Construct graphs listed in MAJOR GOALS
